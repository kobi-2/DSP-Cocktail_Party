## The following mixing matrix is a good one for 3 signals:

A = [0.8, 0.4, 0.2; 
0.4, 0.8, 0.5;
0.2, 0.5, 0.8];



## For the following ones, there are special effects: (here considering 2 audio signals)

1. Mixing weights with patthers like the following have the effect such that the output will be silent
A=[0.8 0.3;
0.8 0.3]

2. Mixing weights with patterns like the following have the effect such that the output will not be silent, but the audios will not be separated very well either
A = [0.3 0.3;
0.8 0.8]
